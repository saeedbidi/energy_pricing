# Energy Price Modelling

This project applies **RandomForest** and **XGBoost** machine learning models to predict energy prices in specific locations in London. The energy price data is collected from a publicly available source, and the project includes the full pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualisation of the results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict energy prices using machine learning models. The dataset contains historical energy pricing data for a specific area of London. The **RandomForest** and **XGBoost** regressors are used to predict the **Unit Price (inc VAT)** for electricity based on time and location features.

The project workflow involves:
- Preprocessing the raw data (removing unnecessary columns and extracting useful features like time and day of the week).
- Training machine learning models.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Visualising actual vs predicted energy prices.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is publicly available from the following sources:
- [Historical Pricing Data - Energy Stats UK](https://energy-stats.uk/download-historical-pricing-data/?_gl=1*17ukjkw*_ga*OTY3NDkxMTIyLjE3Mjg1NTI3MzM.*_ga_M45TVRXZ04*MTcyODU1MjczMi4xLjAuMTcyODU1MjczMi42MC4wLjA.)
- [CSV Data Download Link](https://files.energy-stats.uk/csv_output/)

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **CET Time**: Central European Time (date and time).
- **UK Time (HH:MM)**: Time in the UK timezone.
- **Area Code**: Geographic code for the area.
- **Area Name**: Name of the geographic area.
- **Unit Price**: Energy price in pence per unit.

## Output

Here is a plot comparing the actual vs predicted energy prices generated by the model:

![Predicted vs Actual Energy Prices](output/predictions_plot.png)

The performance of the models is summarised in the evaluation report:

```bash
Performance of RandomForest:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.37
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.39
R-squared: 0.96

Performance of XGBoost:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 2.20
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.27
R-squared: 0.96
